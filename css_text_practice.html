    <h1>Barcelona</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, <a href="none">Spanish</a>, German and English footballers led by Joan
        Gamper, the club has
        become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club").
        Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable
        sports team in the world, worth $4.76 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue,
        with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written
        by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and red stripes,
        hence nicknamed Blaugrana.

        Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 75 trophies: 26 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, thirteen Supercopa de España,
        three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four
        competitions. In international club football, the club has won twenty European and worldwide titles: five UEFA
        Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record
        three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[5] Barcelona was ranked first in the
        International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and
        2015, and occupies the sixth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2022.[6][7][8] The club has a
        long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Beginnings</h3>
    <p>
        On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a
        football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players
        attended – Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto
        Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball
        Club Barcelona was born
    </p>
    <h3>Stabilization</h3>
    <p>
        In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of
        Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied
        to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main
        objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His
        presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict
        policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather
        than meeting their demands.

    <h3>Guardiola Era</h3>
    <p>
        In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in El Clásico. At the ceremony for the
        2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three
        finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for
        2010.[103] In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession,
        finishing with 96 points.[104] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid
        at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[105] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions
        League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup
